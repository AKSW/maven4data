# Messaging

## Synopsis

Once changes to a maven repository [are detected](change-detection.md), appropriate messages need to be sent out and relevant components need to be notified.

## Purpose

A message queuing system helps to decouple message producers from receivers and adds fault tolerance, such as prevention of data loss in case of server crashes.

## Apache Kafka

Apache Kafka is popular, easy to use, and also works from the command line. we just point to the [Quick Start Guide](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart).
