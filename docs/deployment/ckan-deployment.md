# Deploy to CKAN

## Synopsis

> The Comprehensive Knowledge Archive Network (CKAN) is an open-source open data portal for the storage and distribution of open data.

<sub>Quoted from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKAN)</sub>

## Purpose

* Deploying artifacts to CKAN makes them accessible to a wider audience outside of the Maven ecosystem.

## Approach

Try our [ckan-maven-plugin](https://github.com/Scaseco/ckan-maven-plugin).

## Notes

* The plugin is experimental and feedback is greatly welcome!
