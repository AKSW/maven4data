# Maven 4 Data

## Synopsis

This documentation is a guide for how to design Maven projects that can **publish data** with an invocation of:

```bash
mvn deploy
```

This guide presents concepts for one-shot data publishing as well as for automated builds.

## Why not ...

* **use a Workflow Engine?**
There are just too many workflow engines out there, and tying builds to one of them significantly limits portability.
Conversely, every workflow engine is expected to be capable of running a shell script and thus invoke a Maven build.

* **use a different build system rather than Maven?**
One of the main reasons for the choice of maven is that its [naming conventions](artifact-naming.md) fit well with Semantic Web concepts.

## Design Philosophy

* üåê Programming Language Agnostic: The data generation code is in Python rather than Java? No problem.
* üîÑ Reproducible Builds: Run `mvn install` repeatedly to repeatedly carry out the data build.
* üí† Semantic Web Interoperability: Represent [Maven Coordinates](artifact-naming.md) as URNs for use in RDF documents.
* üåà Data Format Agnostic: Although this guide has a Semantic Web / RDF bias, many concepts can be applied to any data format, such as CSV, XML, JSON, text, PDF or ZIP archives.

## Maven-based Data Management

This repository contains guidelines about how to adopt, and adapt and maybe sometimes bend the Maven ecosystem for data generation and publishing.

These guidelines are not only aimed at making it possible to publish data under the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(in brief: findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) but also to have **REPRODUCIBLE** builds, which have become conventional in modern software development.

The idea is simple: Maven provides a framework to version, build and deploy artifacts. Although artifacts are typically JAR files, it is possible to also publish data artifacts.

## Open Issues

* Data artifacts with transitive dependendencies: It is currently unclear (at least to me) whether it is possible to publish maven artifacts that when referenced transitively draw in multiple files (that are outside of JAR files).
Perhaps this could be accomplished with custom life cycles?
* When referencing data with the `build-helper` maven-plugin, the files are copied from the local maven repository to the maven project's workspace.
The copying limits scalability to large datasets - ideally there was an option to create symlinks. It would be possible to fork the plugin but it would be better if this option was added via a PR.
