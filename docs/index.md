## Maven-based Data Management

This repository contains documentation about how the Maven ecosystem can adapted for data generation and publishing.

Following the guidelines not only makes it possible to publish data under the [FAIR principles](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)
(in brief: findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) but also to have **REPRODUCIBLE** builds, which have become conventional in modern software development.

The idea is simple: Maven provides a framework to version, build and deploy (publish) artifacts. Although artifacts are typically JAR files, it is possible to also publish data artifacts.
